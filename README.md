#  PHOTOELASTICITY EXPERIMENT: isoclinic simulation

% MATLAB file "isoclinic_simulation_code.m" contains code for simulating 
% isoclinic patterns and animating isoclinic changes on a photoelastic disc, 
% according to two theoretical models of physical stress maps - the Ovals model 
% and the Wulff net model, as explained in the "photoelasticity_report.pdf" file 
% (sections 1,2,4) and its appendix presentation file "photoelasticity report - 
% video appendix.ppsx".
% The "Photoelasticity presentation.ppsx" contains further demonstrations and 
% animations of the isoclinic simlulation process.
%%

% Code, paper and presentations were created as part of a photoelsticity experiment, 
% carried out in LAB B course of our undergarduate physics studies, at the Hebrew 
% University of Jerusalem.
