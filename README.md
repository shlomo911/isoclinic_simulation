#  PHOTOELASTICITY EXPERIMENT: isoclinic simulation

MATLAB file contains code for simulating isoclinic patterns and animating
isoclinic changes on a photoelastic disc, according to two theoretical models 
% of stress maps - the Ovals model and to the Wulff net model, as explained in 
% our paper "photoelasticity_report" (sections 1,2,4) and demonstrated 
% in the "video_appendix" presenetation (both files are attached).
%
% Code was written as part of a photoelsticity experiment, carried out in LAB B
% course of our undergarduate physics studies, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
